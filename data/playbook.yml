# This playbook expects to be passed:
# - static_pass a list of hosts that need passwords
# - for each host in $static_pass a variable with the same key and the password as the vaLue
# It is anticipated that the static_pass will be configured as extra vars in a Tower Job Template
# It is anticipated that the host=password properties will be capture by a Tower Survey
